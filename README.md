# financial_phrasebank_sentiment_analysis
This project focuses on predicting the sentiment of financial news articles using a BERT-style model. The primary goal is to develop an automated tool that can classify news articles as positive, negative, or neutral, assisting investors and analysts in making informed decisions based on market sentiment.
# Key Contributions:
Data Preparation and Visualization: Loaded and analyzed the Financial Phrasebank dataset, visualizing data distribution and class balance.
Tokenization: Implemented tokenization of text data using the BERT tokenizer to prepare it for model training.
Dataset Splitting: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust evaluation and prevent overfitting.
Model Training: Fine-tuned the BERT model for sequence classification using the Hugging Face Transformers library, setting up training configurations and evaluation strategies.
Evaluation and Analysis: Evaluated the model's performance on the test set, providing insights into accuracy, loss, and areas for potential improvement.
This project demonstrates the application of advanced NLP techniques in the financial domain and serves as a foundation for further research and development in automated sentiment analysis.
